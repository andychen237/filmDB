Addressing feedback:

Thankfully the special characters are not an issue when querying or displaying results. When querying using them,
the queries still execute (for example searching up directors 'Gaspar Noé' and 'Luis Buñuel').
Furthermore, special characters were displayed fine on the interface; an example
is looking up the top shooting locations of Westerns, of which one city is Nuevo León, Mexico which shows up fine.
So though on the MariaDB interface, they're parsed wrongly
when retrieving the results, when displaying them on our interface, they work fine. So 
we decided this was servicable.

We decided to keep dollars as well, since on canvasJS, they separate into commas, so it's more interpretable and user-friendly
than the MariaDB unformatted outputs.
